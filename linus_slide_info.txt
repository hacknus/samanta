TSP with ants:
	circular pattern (go back where you started from)
	very good results on first few tries
	doesnt converge that clearly, still oscillates
	more ants per city -> better results

	with obsticles:
		-if no more allowed cities nearby, they have to cross obsticle -> bad choice, improvement would be to not add it

A to B with ants:
	masking the map with openCV, plant intersections and get allowed streets
	rewrite probability calculation dependant on distance to target
	on target: switch new target to home (homewardbound)
	all ants start on A
	dont let them go where they have already been, otherwise they could oscillate between two intersections
	if only last position is tabu, they run around houses 
	if ant has no more options -> self.kill() but this leaves feromone trail to death
	bad results: because feromones disappear too quickly and feromone trails to theath are left
	we need multiple waves launched within a few moves
	shortest path is found quickly but then oscillations happen (same issue as in TSP)


possible improvements:
	make alpha an beta time dependant
	don't add feromone trails if they result in death (A-B) or crossing obsticle (TSP)
	better adjustment of alpha, beta, rho parameters
